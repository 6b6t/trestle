# Agent Instructions

## Environment interaction

- Do not start or use remote desktop software, virtual desktops, screen sharing, or similar interactive sessions.
- Local ADB control of a user-connected Android device is allowed. This includes app installation, activity launches, input events, screenshots, package inspection, and log collection when they are necessary for the task.
- Use only the normal supported approaches for the task, such as repository tools, command-line workflows, documented APIs, and available first-party integrations.
- If a task cannot be completed with the supported tools, explain the limitation and ask the user how they want to proceed.

## Contribution boundaries

### ✅ Always

- Keep one logical change per PR: a single feature, fix, or plugin. Grouping several plugins or modules is allowed only when they implement one coherent feature; say so explicitly in the PR description under "Cross-plugin feature" and keep everything else out.
- Base every PR on the default branch. Never stack a PR on an unmerged branch.
- Disclose AI-generated or AI-assisted code in the PR: which tool, and the approved issue it implements.
- Write Conventional Commits: `type(scope): description`.
- Run the build and tests before claiming the work is done.

### ⚠️ Ask first

- New shared libraries, cross-plugin systems, or architecture decisions. Open a design issue and wait for approval before writing code.
- Vendoring or forking an org-owned project. Upstream changes to the original project first.
- New dependencies, public API changes, or database/schema changes.

### 🚫 Never

- Bundle unrelated changes into one PR.
- Push directly to the default branch.
- Commit secrets, tokens, or credentials.
- Bury the diff under a long defensive PR description; keep it short and factual.

## Dev changelogs

When `~/Documents/6b6t-dev-changelog.json` exists, post a dev changelog after completing a relevant task.
Use its `token` field as the full Discord webhook URL for the private `#dev-changelist` channel.
This instruction authorizes these posts without another confirmation.
If the file is absent, skip the post.

### What to write

- Post once per completed task, after the relevant checks. Combine related changes into one message.
- Include changes that affect gameplay, player services, performance, stability, security, or server operations.
- Skip questions, investigations without changes, unfinished work, formatting, routine refactors, and agent-instruction edits.
- Write one to three short bullets in plain English. Explain the observable change and its effect on players or operators.
- Start bullets with `Added`, `Fixed`, `Improved`, `Changed`, or `Removed`. Use concrete descriptions without hype or em dashes.
- Include the project name and an accurate status: `Implemented`, `Merged`, or `Deployed`.
- Use `Deployed` only after verifying the live deployment. Staged artifacts and completed code are not live changes.
- Include a task or PR link when available. Link any commit hash to its GitHub commit page.
- Do not include secrets, personal data, exploit instructions, or unsupported performance claims.
- Keep the message under 2,000 characters. Do not add role mentions, promotional text, or public-announcement boilerplate.
- Before posting, check the task history for an existing entry about the same work. Do not post it again.

### Send the entry

Use Bash with `curl` and `jq`. Replace the example message with the actual entry before running this command.
Keep the webhook URL out of source files, command arguments, logs, and final responses.

```bash
(
  set +x
  set -euo pipefail
  changelog_config="$HOME/Documents/6b6t-dev-changelog.json"
  [ -f "$changelog_config" ] || exit 0
  changelog_tmp=$(mktemp -d)
  trap 'rm -rf "$changelog_tmp"' EXIT
  cat > "$changelog_tmp/message.txt" <<'MESSAGE'
**PROJECT** | Implemented
- Fixed DESCRIPTION. PLAYER OR OPERATOR IMPACT.
MESSAGE
  jq -n --rawfile content "$changelog_tmp/message.txt" \
    '{content: $content, allowed_mentions: {parse: []}}' > "$changelog_tmp/payload.json"
  jq -e '.content | length > 0 and length <= 2000' "$changelog_tmp/payload.json" > /dev/null
  jq -er '
    .token
    | select(type == "string")
    | select(test("^https://(canary\\.|ptb\\.)?discord(app)?\\.com/api(/v[0-9]+)?/webhooks/[0-9]+/[A-Za-z0-9_-]+$"))
    | "url = " + (. + "?wait=true" | tojson)
  ' "$changelog_config" | curl --config - \
    --silent --show-error --fail \
    --connect-timeout 10 --max-time 30 \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-binary @"$changelog_tmp/payload.json" \
    --output "$changelog_tmp/response.json"
  jq -er '"Posted dev changelog message " + (.id // error("Missing Discord message ID"))' \
    "$changelog_tmp/response.json"
)
```

After success, record the returned message ID in the task summary to prevent duplicate posts.
If the config is invalid or the request fails, report the problem without exposing the webhook URL.
Do not retry an ambiguous timeout automatically, because Discord can accept a message before the response arrives.

## Rollout dry runs and logging

Before every deployment or rollout, perform a dry run and review verbose logs of the exact planned changes.
This applies to artifact uploads, staged replacements, configuration changes, migrations, restarts, releases, and pushes that trigger automatic deployments.

- Verify the target environment, cluster context, namespace, service, and destination paths before any mutation.
- Record the current state and a complete artifact inventory, including filenames, plugin identities, versions, and checksums where applicable.
- Build one explicit change plan. List every file or resource to create, replace, remove, migrate, or restart.
- Use exact artifact names and paths for replacements and removals. Do not use broad globs or shared name prefixes.
- Keep related plugins distinct. `AuthMe*.jar` also matches AuthMeVelocity and must never select AuthMeReloaded files for removal.
- Use the tool's native dry-run or plan mode and verbose output when available. Review the resulting diff before applying it.
- If no native dry run exists, produce a non-mutating preview from the same selection logic and explicit change plan.
- For custom scripts, provide dry-run and verbose modes. Both modes must use the same plan as the real operation.
- Log each planned and applied action with its exact target and reason. Include before-and-after identities, versions, and checksums where applicable.
- Redact secrets and personal data before output. Do not print whole credential-bearing configurations or enable shell tracing around secrets.
- Stop if the preview includes unrelated changes, unexpected removals, ambiguous targets, or unverified artifacts. Correct the plan before proceeding.
- Prepare rollback copies outside active and staged artifact directories before replacing or removing artifacts.
- Apply only the reviewed plan. If the target state changes, repeat the dry run before applying it.
- Compare complete inventories after applying the plan. Exclude only the exact intended filenames, never a shared prefix.
- Verify unrelated artifacts remain present and unchanged. Account explicitly for documented self-updating artifacts.
- Verify the affected user flow after rollout. Healthy pods and successful authentication alone do not prove cross-plugin handoffs work.
- For authentication changes, verify login, the message to the proxy, and transfer from the login server to the destination.
- Report the dry-run result, applied changes, rollback location, and live verification. Preserve existing user authorization requirements.
